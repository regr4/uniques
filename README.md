this is my solution to the problem posed in matt parker's [latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-AfhLQfb6w&t=0s).
instead of taking a month, it runs in around 37 seconds on my laptop.

i'm pretty sure this can be optimised much further than this,
but i'm reasonably satisfied with sub-minute running time.

this solution is inspired by that shown in <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=947Ewgue4DM&t=0s>.
