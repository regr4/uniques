this is my solution to the problem posed in Matt Parker's [latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-AfhLQfb6w&t=0s).
instead of taking a month, it runs in around 4-6 seconds on my laptop.

this solution is inspired by that shown in <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=947Ewgue4DM&t=0s>.

build: `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo b --release`
benchmark: `./benchmark.sh`
